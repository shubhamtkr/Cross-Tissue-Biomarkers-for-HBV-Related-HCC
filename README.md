# Cross-Tissue-Biomarkers-for-HBV-Related-HCC

Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection is a leading
cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) world-
wide. The development of cross-tissue biomarkers
enables non-invasive diagnostics for early detection of HBV-related HCC. This study aims to identify gene expression patterns in blood and liver tissues to explore potential biomarkers detectable in
blood, reducing the need for liver biopsies
